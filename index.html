    <h4>Projects</h4>  
    <ul>
    <p><li><h5>CYBERBULLYING DETECTION AND PREVENTION- NLP,RNN,SVM and CNN </h5>
    
        Developed a cyberbullying detection and prevention model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify aggressive 
        language in social media posts. The project involved applying Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), 
        and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for text classification, aiming to detect and flag harmful language patterns. The 
        integration of machine learning techniques allowed for improved accuracy in identifying potential cases of cyberbullying. The 
        system was designed to provide timely intervention, contributing to a safer online environment.</li></p>
    
    <p><li><h5>SMART PARKING SYSTEM- Arduino </h5>

        The Smart Parking Project optimizes parking space utilization using IoT and sensors. It provides Real-Time data on available parking 
        spots to drivers entering the parking spot via a display, reducing congestion and time spent searching for parking. The system 
        enhances parking management efficiency, leading to a more streamlined and convenient parking experience. The Arduino Uno 
        offers a simple interface to the user to indicate the presence of vacant parking through a LED display.</li></p>
